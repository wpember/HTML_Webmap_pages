# Welcome
This is a simple repository used to host different interactive web maps and projects for use in my personal website,

wilpemberton.com

More information about the projects and others not requiring embedded html can be found there, including sources. All code is hosted publicly as open source, although I ask that forks created credit my code and the origonal sources listed on the website. Tilesets and database files are hosted privately to avoid misuse, and are subject to change at any time.
